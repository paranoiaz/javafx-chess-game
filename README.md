# JavaFX Chess Game
A simple chess game made in Java using JavaFX for the GUI components. Chess Game is an offline player versus player game but I might add support for online play or the ability to play against a chess bot in the future.

**Dependencies**
```
javafx
```

**Notes**

I have not added moves like castling, pawn promotion and *en passant* so just keep that in mind.
